this is a practice project on web3, it used vite, tailwind, ethers, react-tooltip, web3modal, implemmented with web3 server and client front UI side. 

It also practiced on using high order components, and smart contract interaction, the smart contract is not write by myself, it's the existing one referenced from JSMastery, which could be the reference for future usage. 

Thanks for JSMastery for providing such great learning resources, I had learned a lot along the way following the steps and training my muscule memory. 

Another thing found here, is that it occurs a lot of problem while using wallet, I had tried Core and Metamask, but it might because using developing test coins, it always hard to process the transaction and get the wallet address details. Mark here for future me, might be able to answer this in another 2-3 years lol.
